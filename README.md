# Optimal Probabilistic Framework for Grid Operational Cost Data
This file contains the necessary information to reproduce the results obtained in the proposed optimal probabilistic framework.
The coefficient and values of the grid cost function, the probability distribution values for PV generation, Wind generation and EVs charging demand 
at a specific hour (e.g., 15h)
The grid data format OpenDSS for the IEEE 33 bus.
